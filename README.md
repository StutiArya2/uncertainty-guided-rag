# Uncertainty-Guided Reversible Evidence Compression RAG System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that compresses retrieved evidence in an
uncertainty-aware, *reversible* manner — reducing token load while preserving the ability
to restore evidence when claim support is insufficient.

Runs fully locally: no API keys, no per-query cost.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **User Query** → submitted by the user
2. **Retrieval** → pulls candidate documents from the Knowledge Base (KB)
3. **Evidence Mapping** → maps retrieved evidence to individual claims (claim-wise)
4. **Initial Evidence Set** → full, high-token evidence set per claim
5. **Uncertainty-Guided Compression** → compresses evidence based on uncertainty estimates, reducing token count
6. **Claim Support Evaluation** → checks whether compressed evidence is sufficient to support each claim
   - **Sufficient** → proceed to Output Generation
   - **Insufficient** →
     6.1. **Evidence Restoration** → reverses compression to recover fuller evidence
     6.2. **Re-evaluation** → re-checks claim support with restored evidence
       - **Sufficient** → Output Generation
       - **Still insufficient** → **Abstain / Clarify / Retrieve More**
7. **Output Generation** → final answer generation once evidence is sufficient

Restoration is applied **per claim**: claims whose compressed evidence was already
sufficient keep their savings, and only the claims that actually failed pay their full
evidence cost back.

## Current Results

Measured on **QASPER**: 287 expert-written questions over 110 real NLP papers. Full run
records, with the commit and command that produced each, are in [`artifacts/`](artifacts/).
See [`docs/PAPER-OUTLINE.md`](docs/PAPER-OUTLINE.md) for the write-up these support.

**Scope, stated up front:** this is *known-document* long-document QA, not open-corpus RAG.
QASPER questions are asked about one named paper and are not self-identifying ("which
datasets did *they* use?"), so retrieval is restricted to that paper. A deployed system
would first have to *find* the document; we do not evaluate that step. Run without the
restriction, the baseline scored ~1% F1 and abstained on 83% of answerable questions.

### What the evidence supports

> **Compression is not free.** An earlier version of this README claimed ~39% token
> reduction "at no measurable quality cost". That held only on a Qwen2.5-0.5B generator,
> which was too weak to exploit the evidence being removed. On Qwen2.5-1.5B the same
> compression costs **5.4 answer-F1 points** (0.2497 → 0.1957, p=0.0001). The trade is
> real and defensible; it was simply not the trade being claimed.

**1. Reversible compression turns selection quality into a cost curve — and the exchange
rate is set by how well the system detects its own losses.** Ranked selection beats random
selection at the same nominal budget, and by *twice as much* once the loss detector is
improved:

| restoration trigger | detector miss rate (random) | ranked − random reduction |
|---|---|---|
| `absolute` (topical threshold) | 55.6% | **+14.2 pp** |
| `relative` (vs full-set support) | 23.2% | **+26.3 pp** |

Random's realised reduction collapses from 39.0% to 17.9% under the better detector — its
restoration rate rises from 48.8% to 76.0%, so it keeps handing its savings back. Ranked
selection still returns 44.2%. Clustered over 109 papers, both p=0.0001.

Answer quality is unaffected either way (ranked − random F1: +0.0024, p=0.85). In a
reversible system, good selection buys **tokens, not accuracy** — which is the point.

**2. Uncertainty-guided allocation adds nothing.** +0.0052 F1 vs a fixed ratio at matched
budget, clustered CI [−0.0047, +0.0164], p=0.39 — inside the ±0.02 declared in advance, and
the sign flips at a milder budget. The founding premise (*confident retrieval implies
redundant evidence*) is false here: retrieval confidence carries almost no information
about whether evidence answers the question — the top-ranked unit contains the gold answer
22% of the time against a 12% chance baseline, correlation +0.045.

**3. The restoration trigger misses most losses it exists to catch.** Scored against
QASPER's human-marked answer evidence, `absolute` fails to fire on **76.5%** of questions
where compression removed needed evidence, and 77.9% where it removed *all* of it.
`relative` reduces that to 58.8% / 60.3%. Still poor, reported as the open problem rather
than hidden — and it is now a measurable target where the project previously had an
untested safety assertion.

**4. An oracle selector reaches baseline quality at 48.9% reduction with a 0% miss rate.**
On the 0.5B generator its quality edge over ranked selection was not significant (+0.0136,
p=0.27) — consistent with that model being the bottleneck rather than the selector. What
the oracle does establish unambiguously is the safety target: perfect selection never
drops needed evidence, so a detector should be measured against 0%, not against the
`absolute` trigger's 76.5%.

**5. Results depend on the generator, so it is named everywhere.** Qwen2.5-0.5B is the
default because the archived runs used it; Qwen2.5-1.5B is the robustness check and is
where the compression cost becomes visible. Any compression result is implicitly a claim
about the model it was measured on, and a cheap model will understate the cost.

```

### Reading the numbers honestly

- **Two reductions are reported, and the smaller one is the real one.** 53.0% of *evidence*
  tokens is **38.6% of the prompt**: the preamble, claim labels, title prefixes, question
  and chat template do not compress. Quote the prompt figure.
- **Intervals are clustered by paper.** Questions from one paper are correlated; treating
  them as independent is pseudo-replication and reports a narrower interval than the data
  supports.
- **Random is a distribution over 20 seeds**, not one draw. Its reduction ranged
  **27.8–52.7%** — a single unlucky draw would have put it level with ranked selection.
  Our own earlier single-seed figure was inflated by 5 points.
- **Thresholds are per-corpus.** The support threshold calibrated on the hand-built KB
  abstains on ~half of *answerable* QASPER questions. Calibrate with
  `scripts/calibrate_threshold.py`; never carry a threshold between corpora.

### The earlier hand-built result

The 24-document / 16-question run (43.3% reduction, keyword recall 56.7% → 60.0%) is kept
in [`artifacts/handbuilt-16q/`](artifacts/handbuilt-16q/). It is a smoke test, not a
benchmark, and two of its conclusions did not survive contact with real papers — see
`docs/PAPER-OUTLINE.md`.

## How It Works

### Reversibility

Evidence is never a free-floating string. Every unit is a **`Span`** — `(doc_id, start,
end)` character offsets into a source document. Compression drops spans from the
*prompt*; it never destroys them. Restoration re-resolves dropped spans **from the
corpus**, so reversibility is a verifiable property of the span index rather than an
artifact of keeping a backup copy in memory.

`tests/test_compression.py` asserts that both recovery routes — reinstating retained
copies, and re-reading text from spans — produce byte-identical evidence, at every
compression level. `scripts/run_eval.py` re-checks the same property on real retrieved
evidence rather than fixtures.

**What is actually compressed:** the saving is in tokens *sent to the generator*, not in
RAM. Dropped units stay in memory so restoration is immediate.

### Uncertainty

Uncertainty is derived from retrieval scores — no extra model calls, fully deterministic:

```
u_claim    = w_score * (1 - s_top) + w_margin * (1 - margin / margin_scale)
keep_ratio = min_keep + u_claim * (max_keep - min_keep)
```

Two independent failure signals are combined. A **low top score** means nothing in the KB
matches the claim well. A **narrow margin** means the top hit is barely ahead of the next,
so the ranking is unstable and dropping the rest is risky precisely there.

Low uncertainty → compress hard. High uncertainty → keep more. `UncertaintyEstimator` is
an interface; token-logprob and self-consistency estimators are planned as ablations.

### Claim support

Claims are decomposed from the **query**, which avoids the circularity of verifying text
the model just invented. That choice determines how support must be scored.

Query-derived claims are *topics*, not assertions, so NLI entailment is the wrong tool for
them — measured with DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli, "dense retrieval differ from lexical
retrieval" scored **0.009** while the bare noun "dense retrieval" scored **0.877**. The
model was answering its own question correctly, just not ours, and it produced a 14.3%
false-abstain rate on questions the KB plainly answers.

A **relevance cross-encoder** asks what we actually mean — "does this evidence address
this claim?" — and separates cleanly on the same set (lowest answerable claim 0.205,
highest unanswerable 0.001), taking false abstentions to **0%**.

Both scorers ship behind one interface (`evaluation.scorer` in config). NLI becomes the
correct choice if claims are ever decomposed from a draft answer instead, since those
*are* assertions.

Evidence is scored **title-prefixed**. Sentence chunks are often anaphoric — "The function
has two tunable parameters" never names BM25 — and without the document title the scorer
cannot resolve the subject (measured 0.004 → 0.997 for the same chunk).

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.14**, PyTorch (MPS/CUDA/CPU auto-selected)
- **Retrieval** — mean-pooled `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings, exact brute-force cosine
  over numpy. No FAISS: for a KB this size exact search is fast, always returns the true
  nearest neighbours, and avoids approximate-index tuning as a silent source of recall loss.
- **Claim support** — `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` (relevance) or
  `DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli-fever-anli-ling-wanli` (entailment)
- **Generation** — `Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct`, greedy decoding for reproducibility.
  `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` is a drop-in upgrade; the default is the smaller model so the
  shipped config matches the numbers reported above.
- Dependencies: `torch`, `transformers`, `numpy`, `pyyaml`, `pytest` — that is all

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StutiArya2/uncertainty-guided-rag.git
cd uncertainty-guided-rag

# --system-site-packages reuses an already-installed torch instead of
# re-downloading ~2.5 GB. Drop it for a fully isolated environment.
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python scripts/seed_kb.py         # write the starter knowledge base
```

Model weights download automatically on first run (~4 GB total).

## The reading room (web interface)

```bash
python -m src.server        # opens http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

A local, non-technical way to use the system: add papers, ask questions, and see the
exact sentences each answer was built from.

It is built on the standard library's `http.server` — no Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, or
Gradio — because a GUI is not a good reason to add a web framework to a five-package
dependency list. Everything is served from `web/index.html`.

What it shows, and why:

- **The marked-up passage.** Sentences the system used are highlighted; sentences it set
  aside stay visible but dimmed. Compression stops being a statistic and becomes
  something you can see and check.
- **Plain language, not scores.** `uncertainty 0.496` becomes "Reasonable match";
  `support 0.72` becomes "Evidence: Strong". Raw numbers stay one click away under
  **Technical detail**.
- **Held back is a first-class outcome.** When the papers don't answer the question, the
  interface says so in the answer's place and suggests what to do — it never fills the
  gap with a guess.
- **Restoration is visible.** If compression removed something that turned out to be
  needed, those sentences are tagged `set aside · brought back`.

Papers are stored as plain `.txt` in `data/kb/`, identical to what `scripts/seed_kb.py`
writes, so anything added through the browser works with every other tool in the repo.
Adding a paper re-embeds the index; the scorer and generator stay loaded.

PDF import needs `pypdf`, which is deliberately **not** in `requirements.txt` (see the
dependency note in CLAUDE.md). Without it, pasting text and `.txt` upload still work and
the interface says exactly how to enable PDFs.

### What the interface is good at showing you

Asking a freshly added paper "What are global tokens in sparse attention?" produced a
**confidently wrong answer** — it described sliding-window attention instead, because
compression had set aside the one sentence that defined global tokens, and the support
scorer still rated the remaining evidence 0.72, so restoration never fired.

The interface made that visible: the dropped sentence is right there on screen, greyed
out, directly above an answer that contradicts it. That is the honest argument for
showing evidence rather than only answers — and it is a real limitation of the current
support scorer, recorded under Planned extensions below.

## Command line

```bash
# Single query, with the stage-by-stage trace
python -m src.pipeline --query "What are the two tunable parameters of BM25?" --trace

# Machine-readable trace
python -m src.pipeline --query "What is calibration?" --json

# No-compression baseline, for comparison
python -m src.pipeline --query "What is calibration?" --mode identity --trace

# The headline result: compressed vs uncompressed
python scripts/run_eval.py
python scripts/run_eval.py --no-generate       # token/branch metrics only, fast
```

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v                     # everything
pytest tests/ -m "not integration"   # skip tests needing model weights
pytest tests/test_compression.py -v  # the reversibility gate
```

`tests/test_compression.py::TestRoundTrip` is the gate for the project: compression is
only legitimate if it can be undone exactly. If it fails, every other result is
untrustworthy.

## Project Status

- Target milestone: Mid-August — baseline pipeline (stages 1–7) working end-to-end **and
  measured against a no-compression baseline** ✅
- Longer-term goal: Fall '26–'27 mini-project extension, targeting conference/journal
  submission (indexed publication)

### Planned extensions

- **Topical support is not answer support.** The relevance scorer rates evidence that is
  *about* the claim highly, even when the specific sentence that answers it has been
  dropped — measured live in the web interface: support 0.72 on evidence that produced a
  wrong answer, so restoration never triggered. Detecting "on-topic but not answering"
  is the most valuable open problem in the pipeline, and the strongest argument for
  decomposing claims from a draft answer instead of the query.
- **Graded restoration** — restore in tiers and re-check between them, instead of jumping
  straight back to full evidence, preserving more of the saving on the restore path
- **Alternative uncertainty estimators** — token logprobs, self-consistency sampling; the
  ablation comparing them is the natural headline table for a paper
- **Draft-answer claim decomposition** — verifies exactly what will be shown to the user,
  and makes NLI entailment the correct support scorer
- **Abstractive compression** — higher ratios, but not invertible from its output alone,
  so it needs a different reversibility mechanism
- **Larger evaluation** — the current 16-question set is a smoke test, not a benchmark
