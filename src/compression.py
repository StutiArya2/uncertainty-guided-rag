"""Pipeline stage 4 — uncertainty-guided reversible evidence compression.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY COMPRESSED (stated explicitly, per CLAUDE.md):
the saving is in tokens *sent to the generator*, not in memory. Dropped units are
retained in `CompressedEvidence.dropped` so restoration is immediate, and each one keeps
its `Span`, so the original text remains recoverable from the corpus even if those
retained copies were discarded. Both recovery routes are asserted equivalent by the
round-trip test in tests/test_compression.py.

Compression is extractive — whole evidence units are kept or dropped, never rewritten.
That is what makes restoration exact rather than approximate. Abstractive compression
would reach higher ratios but could not be inverted from its output alone, which would
break the core guarantee of the project.

Four modes, three of which exist to make the central claim falsifiable:

  identity           — no-op. The no-compression baseline.
  uncertainty_guided — keep budget scales with claim uncertainty. The proposal.
  fixed_ratio        — keeps a constant fraction, top-ranked first. Ablates the
                       *adaptivity* while holding the budget and the ranking fixed.
  random             — keeps a constant fraction chosen at random. Ablates the
                       ranking too, so it separates "score order matters" from
                       "uncertainty-driven budgeting matters".

Comparing uncertainty_guided against identity only shows that compression saves
tokens, which is trivially true of any method that discards evidence. The fixed_ratio
arm is what tests whether *uncertainty* is doing the work, and it is only meaningful
when both arms spend the same budget — scripts/run_eval.py calibrates it to do so.
