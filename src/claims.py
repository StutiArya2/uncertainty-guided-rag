"""Pipeline stage 2a — decompose a query into independently verifiable claims.

Claims are derived from the *query*, not from a draft answer. That avoids the circularity
of verifying text the model just invented, at the cost that a claim set may not cover
everything the final answer asserts (see CLAUDE.md / README for the tradeoff).

One empirical finding drives the design here. The downstream NLI evaluator scores a
claim as a *hypothesis*, and it handles a raw interrogative very poorly — measured on
the seeded KB with a known-relevant premise:

    hypothesis form                  P(entailment)
    "What are the tunable...?"           0.033     <- raw question, unusable
    "the tunable parameters of BM25"     0.987     <- topic phrase

So claims are emitted as declarative topic phrases with the subject retained, not as
questions. Stripping the interrogative frame is all that is required — full
question-to-statement rewriting is not needed and would need a model call.
