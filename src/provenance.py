"""Record exactly what produced a result, automatically.

Every number in the paper has to trace back to a commit, a config, a dataset and an
environment. Collecting that by hand is how a reproducibility section ends up describing
a run that no longer exists — the config drifts, a threshold moves, and the recorded
command stops producing the recorded number with nothing to show it changed.

So this is captured by the harness on every run and embedded in the result JSON itself.
Not a separate step anyone has to remember.

Nothing here may raise. A provenance failure must degrade to a recorded `null` and let
the experiment finish — losing an hour of compute to a missing `git` binary would be an
absurd trade for metadata.
