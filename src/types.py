"""Core data model for the uncertainty-guided reversible compression pipeline.

The central design decision lives here: evidence is never a free-floating string. Every
piece of evidence is a `Span` — (doc_id, start, end) character offsets into a source
document. Compression drops spans from the *prompt*; it never destroys them. Restoration
re-resolves dropped spans from the corpus.

That makes reversibility a verifiable property of the span index rather than an artifact
of "we happened to keep a backup" — see `Span.resolve` and the round-trip test in
tests/test_compression.py.
